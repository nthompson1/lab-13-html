	<p> Today is a beautiful day its windy, the air is crisp hitting you in the face as gravity keep you balanced.  I had to wear a long coat, scarf, hat, gloves, just to stay warm.  I look at people walking their dogs, and as I stare at the cute little outfits they wear wiggling around as they walk.  I then started to think deeper maybe if we had gear to keep human beings warm or cold depending on the weather we can save energy and do more. Then I thought SONY GEAR!</p>
	<p id="myid"> I began to drift off thinking how the hell animals stay warm during cold increment weather and cool in the heat.  How am I a superior human being over an animal, and they were granted the opportunity to stay cozy, and warm in such cold weather.

Then I thought SONY GEAR! they is gear for becoming a fish under water so why not innovate new automated gear for increment weather. <a href>http://delemma.com.au/air-conditioned-clothing%E2%80%A6%E2%80%A6%E2%80%A6%E2%80%A6%E2%80%A6-no-more-long-hot-days</a href>
